        <h3 class="title">What is it?</h2>
        <p class="description">It's a security camera that provides live video over a local network, accurate person detection system through an object recognition model, remote control options
        to turn the camera right and left with a range of 180 degrees, and integration with the Telegram API to send notifications of detected people through a Telegram bot.

        <h3 class="title">How does it work?</h3>
        <p class="description">It's all running on a Raspberry Pi 3B, it uses a webcam and a servo motor. These are the 3 main physical components.
        It was all coded in Python 3 making use of the Flask Framework for the webpage and the OpenCV module for the images and the
        Object Recognition. It uses a pre-trained model downloaded from the Internet, which can be used by a certain method of the opencv
        module, that passes the image to the Object Recognition model and returns a dictionary of all of the detected objects, this process goes on frame by frame
        until it finally detects a person, with a considerable percentage of confidence, following to send this exact frame through a Telegram bot using the Telegram API.</p>
